**👋 Hi, I’m Caleb Wodi**, a **15-year-old teen founder** from Port Harcourt, Nigeria, and I build **apps, websites, games, and AI projects**.... all from my **Android phone** (yes, no laptop yet 😅).  

On **April 30, 2025**, I launched **[Rocjet Technologies Ltd](https://github.com/Calchiwo/RocjetTechnologies)**  

I’m also the creator of **[BuiltByWodi®](https://builtbywodi.netlify.app)**, my personal tech brand where I experiment, learn, and share my journey.
