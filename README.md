## 👋 Hi, I'm Caleb Wodi

I am a 15-year-old founder and software developer from Nigeria. I build **apps📱, games🎮, and AI tools🤖**, all from my **Android phone**. I am self-taught, curious, and always learning by doing. My mission is to make tech accessible, fun, and inspiring for everyone. Let’s connect and create something amazing together.
