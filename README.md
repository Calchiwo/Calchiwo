## **ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Caleb Wodi

I'm a teen founder from Port Harcourt, Nigeria. I build apps, games, and AI projects, all from my Android phone.

On **April 30, 2025**, I founded **[Rocjet Technologies Ltd](https://github.com/RocjetTechnologies)** in an uncompleted building near my home, with a simple belief:
you don't need perfect tools to build world-changing technology.

Iâ€™m also the creator of **[BuiltByWodiÂ®](https://builtbywodi.netlify.app)**, my personal tech brand where I experiment, learn, and share my journey.
