## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **15-year-old tech founder** from Nigeria, and I build **apps, websites, games, and AI projects**—all from my **Android phone** (yes, no laptop yet 😅).  

On **April 30, 2025**, I launched **[Rocjet Technologies Ltd](https://github.com/Calchiwo/RocjetTechnologies)**, and I’m on a mission to **turn ideas into reality**—one project at a time.  

I’m also the creator of **[BuiltByWodi®](https://builtbywodi.netlify.app)**, my personal tech brand where I experiment, learn, and share my journey.
