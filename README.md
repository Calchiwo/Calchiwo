## **ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Caleb Wodi**, a **teen founder** from Port Harcourt, Nigeria, and I build **apps, games, and AI projects**.... all from my **Android phone** (yes, no laptop yet ðŸ˜…).  

On **April 30, 2025**, I founded **[Rocjet Technologies Ltd](https://github.com/RocjetTechnologies)** in an uncompleted building near my home, with the vision of creating an AI-first Technology company.

Iâ€™m also the creator of **[BuiltByWodiÂ®](https://builtbywodi.netlify.app)**, my personal tech brand where I experiment, learn, and share my journey.
